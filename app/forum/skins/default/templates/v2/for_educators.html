            <h3>What is CareerVillage?</h3>
            CareerVillage is an online community where students ask professional development questions and working professionals answer them. It is supported by a dedicated non-profit. Our mission: CareerVillage strives to empower students to think about their future and to obtain the information they need to achieve their aspirations.

            <h3>How does the program work?</h3>
            We provide our partners with all of the materials they need to run a 6-week CareerVillage program with their students. This includes materials on how CareerVillage can fit into your curriculum, sample lesson plans with accompanying slides and handouts to help students ask better questions, student FAQs, and easily-or-automatically gradable homework assignments and competitions to help students engage.
